## 🔌 API Setup (Optional)

The app works with fallback data, but for live data:

```bash
# 1. Create .env file in project/ folder
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Add API keys
VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_key
VITE_NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key
# CoinGecko needs no key!

# 3. Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

**Get Free API Keys:**
- OpenWeatherMap: https://openweathermap.org/api
- NewsAPI: https://newsapi.org/

---

## 📊 What Works Without API Keys

✅ **Everything works!** The app has fallback data:
- Weather shows default Kolkata data
- News shows sample articles
- Crypto works (no key needed)
- Calendar uses localStorage
- Email uses localStorage
- Recent items use localStorage

You'll see console warnings about missing keys, but functionality is intact.
