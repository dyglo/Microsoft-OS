# Phase 1: Basic Windows OS Replica with Core Functionality

## Overview
This phase focuses on building the foundational structure of a Windows 11-inspired web application. The goal is to create a functional desktop environment that users can interact with for basic daily tasks, while setting up the architecture for future expansions like AI integration and advanced features. We'll start with core components based on the existing codebase and the provided images, ensuring the interface is responsive and user-friendly.

The app will simulate a Windows desktop where users can manage files, tasks, and projects in a familiar interface. It will run entirely in the browser as a web app.

## High-Level Description of Windows Functionality
Windows OS provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing hardware, software, and user interactions. Key elements include:
- **Desktop**: The main screen with background, icons for quick access to files/apps, and right-click context menus.
- **Taskbar**: Bottom bar with Start button, search, pinned apps, system tray (notifications, clock, quick settings).
- **Start Menu**: Accessed via Start button; shows pinned apps, search, recommended items, user profile, and power options.
- **Widgets/Notifications**: Side panel for quick info like weather, news, calendar.
- **File Management**: Folders and files that users can create, move, rename, delete; supports drag-and-drop.
- **Apps and Windows**: Openable applications with minimize, maximize, close functionality.
- **Multitasking**: Task view for switching between open windows.
- **System Features**: Settings, search, clipboard, etc.

In this web app replica, we'll adapt these to browser constraints, using React for state management and local storage for persistence.

## Phase 1 Goals
- Establish core UI components matching the provided images.
- Implement basic interactivity and state persistence.
- Add minimal functional features for daily use (e.g., basic file/folder management for project planning).
- Prepare hooks for AI integration via Copilot (but not implement AI yet).

## Step-by-Step Plan

### Step 1: Setup and Core Structure
- **Enhance App.tsx**: 
  - Solidify desktop layout with dynamic background (allow user to change wallpaper).
  - Implement desktop icon management (add, remove, drag-and-drop icons).
  - Add right-click context menu for desktop (e.g., new folder, refresh).
- **Persistence**: Use localStorage to save desktop state (icons, positions, open windows).

### Step 2: Taskbar Improvements
- **Taskbar.tsx**:
  - Make search functional: Search across apps, files, and settings.
  - Add pinned apps that can actually open windows (e.g., File Explorer, Settings).
  - Implement system tray with clickable icons (e.g., show notifications panel).
  - Add taskbar icons for open windows (with previews on hover).

### Step 3: Start Menu Enhancements
- **StartMenu.tsx**:
  - Make pinned apps launchable (open corresponding windows).
  - Implement recommended section with recent files/tasks.
  - Add user profile menu with sign-out, settings access.
  - Power button for "shutdown" (clear session) or "restart" (reload app).

### Step 4: Widgets Panel
- **WidgetsPanel.tsx**:
  - Make widgets dynamic: Fetch real data (e.g., weather via API, news feed).
  - Allow adding/removing widgets.
  - Integrate calendar with user-added events/tasks for daily planning.

### Step 5: Basic File Management
- Create a new File Explorer component:
  - Display folder structure (using virtual file system in localStorage).
  - Allow creating folders/files for project plans (e.g., text notes, task lists).
  - Support drag-and-drop, rename, delete.
  - Desktop icons link to folders/files.

### Step 6: Task Management
- Integrate a simple task app (accessible via Start Menu or desktop icon):
  - Create, edit, delete tasks.
  - Categorize by projects (using folders).
  - Reminders/notifications in system tray.

### Step 7: Window Management
- Implement a window manager system:
  - Openable windows for apps (e.g., File Explorer, Task App).
  - Features: Minimize to taskbar, maximize, close, resize, drag.
  - Z-index management for overlapping windows.

### Step 8: Copilot Placeholder
- In Taskbar, make Copilot icon clickable.
- Open a basic panel with placeholder for AI features (e.g., "AI Assistant Coming Soon").
- Plan for integration: Use an AI API (e.g., Grok or OpenAI) for queries like task suggestions, project planning help.

### Step 9: Testing and Polish
- Ensure responsiveness across devices (though primarily desktop-focused).
- Add keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Win key for Start Menu).
- Basic theming (light/dark mode).
- User testing for daily use scenarios (e.g., creating a project folder with tasks).

## Timeline and Milestones
- **1**: Core structure and taskbar (Steps 1-2).
- **2**: Start Menu and Widgets (Steps 3-4).
- **3**: File/Task Management (Steps 5-6).
- **4**: Window System and Copilot (Steps 7-8).
- **5**: Testing and refinements (Step 9).

## Future Phases Teaser
- Phase 2: Advanced features (multi-user, cloud sync via Supabase).
- Phase 3: Full AI integration (natural language processing for tasks, automation).
- Phase 4: More apps (browser, media player) and performance optimizations.

This plan will be updated as we progress. Track changes in subsequent phase files or version control commits.
